## Description
The provided Software Product iCal-API (ICAL) was created in order to facilitate the workflow with calendar files files (i.e. `.ics`), which are not very readable and are often used in order to store calendar data such that it can easily be implemented into an electronic calendar on your phone or a similar device.
**ICAL** allows a user to output the formatted calendar data in a human-readable way, such that he can check for events and have insigths to the data. A more sophisticated use is also provided, allowing to use ICAL as an API for a pipeline or configure it to get a software which is capable of outputting the calendar the data in tailor made fashion for the day-to-day user.
This tool was created out of the need to facilitate the access to the time schedule of a University Program which was only visible on the website online. Instead of reloading and login in to the page everytime. The calendar file will be downloaded and fed into a program which retrieves the necessary data from the file and either processes it further or outputs it directly. Since the time schedules might change more or less often depending on the Institution, ICAL can be quickly run from the terminal or even be embedded into a larger program which could for example reguarly check for changes in the time schedule and notify the user.
